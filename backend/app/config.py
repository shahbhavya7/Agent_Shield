# --- Concurrency -------------------------------------------------------------
# How many agents one batch crash-tests at the same time. Under Temporal this is passed

# no longer a process-wide cap. WORK_CONCURRENCY below is what bounds total load globally.

# Ceiling on in-flight scenario/judge/fix work, applied by the Temporal worker as
# max_concurrent_activities. Every workflow on that worker draws from this one pool, so it
# is a genuinely global limit — stronger than the per-process asyncio semaphore it
# replaced. Without it, N concurrent agent tests would each open their own window onto the
# LLM and the agents under test.
#
# Set to 3 x AGENT_CONCURRENCY, so that even at maximum fan-out every agent gets 3
# concurrent scenarios rather than a token 1 or 2. Measured against the sample agents:
# median response time is flat from 1 to 9 concurrent requests (~0.9s) and only the tail
# starts moving at 12 (max 3.8s). Since the fair share means ONE agent never sees more
# than WORK_CONCURRENCY requests at a time, 9 keeps per-agent load inside that flat zone
# — which matters because load-induced timeouts would show up as the agent's failures,
# not ours. Lower it for a slower or more fragile agent under test.

# agent tests run — a workflow waiting on an activity holds no slot at all. Keep it

# itself, which starves concurrency instead of bounding it. WORK_CONCURRENCY is the knob
# that bounds actual load.
