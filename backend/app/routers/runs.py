"""/runs API — launch crash-test runs (one agent or many in parallel) and poll them.

Execution belongs to Temporal. These endpoints do three things and stop: validate the
request, write the run rows so the client immediately has ids to poll, and submit one
RunGroupWorkflow. They never wait for a run — progress is read back from PostgreSQL by
GET /runs/group/{id}, which is why none of this is visible to the frontend.
