"""/inventory API — the customer -> agents combinations, and their stored test cases.

Sample combinations come from backend/inventory.yaml (seeded into PostgreSQL at startup);
agents connected through "Connect Your AI Agent" are appended straight from PostgreSQL,
which is the source of truth for them. Each agent carries its `customer_agent_id` — the id
everything downstream keys off, because the same agent onboarded for two customers is two
separate testing contexts.
