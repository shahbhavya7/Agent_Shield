"""Twilio voice transport — Phase 3B: ONE CALL FOR THE WHOLE SCENARIO.

Bridges a text scenario's turns onto a REAL PHONE CALL via Twilio Programmable Voice +
Media Streams. Unlike http_json/websocket, Twilio's Media Streams protocol is a
continuous, unsegmented mulaw/8kHz audio pipe with no "end of turn" signal — the real
engineering content of this module is translating that into the same discrete
"one turn's audio in, one turn's audio out" shape every other transport already uses,
AND (Phase 3B) doing so repeatedly over ONE persistent call rather than one call each.

    _call_via_twilio(agent, message, history, faults, session_key, is_last_turn)
        FIRST turn for a given `session_key` (run_scenario()'s stable per-conversation
        id — see runner.py):
            1. TTS the tester's text (REUSED, unchanged: app.core.llm.text_to_speech)
            2. convert WAV -> mulaw/8kHz (this module, pure Python, no audioop)
            3. originate ONE outbound call via the Twilio REST API, pointing its TwiML
               webhook at THIS process with a fresh, unguessable correlation key
            4. wait for that call's Media Stream to connect back to /twilio/media
        EVERY turn (first and subsequent — steps 5-8 repeat per turn on the SAME call):
            5. hand this turn's audio to the (already-connected, already-running)
               Media Stream handler and wait for it to come back with the agent's
               buffered reply (a simple silence/timeout heuristic decides when the
               agent has stopped speaking — NOT production-grade VAD)
            6. convert the buffered mulaw back to WAV, STT it (REUSED, unchanged)
            7. return {"reply": text, "trace": dict} to run_scenario()
        Only once run_scenario()'s turn loop is fully done (`close_voice_session()`,
        called from its `finally` — see runner.py) does the call actually hang up.

Session store (app.routers.twilio <-> this module): two in-memory dicts pointing at
the same _Session objects — `_SESSIONS_BY_KEY` (keyed by run_scenario()'s
`session_key`, so `_call_via_twilio` can find/reuse the SAME session across every
turn of one scenario) and `_SESSIONS_BY_CONV_KEY` (keyed by a random, unguessable
`conv_key`, threaded through Twilio's own request plumbing — the webhook's query
string, then the <Stream> custom parameter, then the Media Stream's
`start.customParameters` — so the webhook/stream can find the right session without
ever seeing `session_key` itself). No new database table; nothing here outlives one
test conversation.

A session is created BEFORE the outbound REST call is placed (so a webhook/stream
that arrives immediately can never race ahead of us). On any failure it is marked
`closed` (and the call hung up) but deliberately NOT removed from the dicts yet — a
subsequent turn on the SAME session_key must still be able to see "this session
existed but died" and fail fast, rather than silently starting a second call. Final
removal happens only in `close_twilio_session()`, guaranteed exactly once by
run_scenario()'s `finally`. Turns are serialized through one `asyncio.Queue` per
session — the Media Stream handler processes exactly one turn at a time, by
construction, so audio from one turn can never leak into another's buffer.

Failure handling mirrors every other transport: any failure (bad phone number, Twilio
API error, the call never connects, a dead session reused after a prior failure, a
malformed Media Stream message, empty/invalid audio, STT failure) resolves to the
same AGENT_ERROR_SENTINEL ("<error>") the rest of the system already knows how to
score as a system failure — no Judge change needed.

NO audioop: it is deprecated and removed in Python 3.13. mu-law encode/decode here is
a small, self-contained implementation of the standard ITU-T G.711 algorithm.
