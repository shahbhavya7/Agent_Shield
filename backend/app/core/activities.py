"""Activity boundary — every unit of external I/O that a run performs, named in one place.

Split out from the orchestrator so that workflow-level logic (sequencing, fan-out,
failure policy) holds no I/O of its own. Each function below is exactly one unit of work
against the outside world: PostgreSQL, the LLM, or the agent under test.

Every activity here is:
  * addressed by plain serializable arguments — ints, dicts, lists — and never by a live
    database row, because a row cannot cross a process boundary;
  * idempotent, so re-executing it converges instead of duplicating (see the idem_key
    work in app.db);
  * a single unit of work, so it can later carry its own timeout and retry policy.

Each one is registered as a Temporal Activity via @activity.defn, and the sync/async
split below is a deliberate contract, not an accident:

  * SYNC ACTIVITY (plain ``def``) — the body blocks on psycopg. Temporal runs these on the
    worker's ThreadPoolExecutor, so a slow query never stalls the worker's event loop.
    Writing them as ``async def`` would be a lie that blocks the loop on every query.
  * ASYNC ACTIVITY (``async def``) — genuinely awaitable I/O: the LLM, or the agent under
    test over httpx. These run on the event loop, where they belong.

Timeouts and retry policies are NOT set here. They belong to the caller, and live in
app.temporal.policies so they can be reviewed in one place.

Nothing here decides *when* it runs — that is the orchestrator's job. Every function is
also callable directly, which is what the current asyncio path still does; @activity.defn
only attaches metadata.
