"""AI Caller — the voice-modality "turn" function for app.core.runner.run_scenario().

`call_voice_agent()` is a small dispatcher over per-protocol transports, keyed on the
agent's configured `voice_protocol` (default "http_json" — see app.db). It returns the
exact ``{"reply": str, "trace": dict}`` shape ``adapter.send()`` already returns, so
``run_scenario()`` can call this in place of ``adapter.send()`` with NO change to its
turn loop, persistence, idempotency, or adaptive-follow-up logic, REGARDLESS of which
transport actually plays the turn. Only WHICH function plays a turn differs; everything
downstream — messages, Judge, scoring, finalization — only ever sees text, exactly as
before. Chat-modality runs never import or execute this module.

Currently implemented:
  "http_json"  -> _call_via_http_json(): TTS the tester's text -> base64 WAV
      -> app.core.adapter.send() [REUSED, unchanged HTTP infra: request templating,
         auth header, timeout/error handling, system-fault simulation]
      -> base64 WAV reply -> STT -> text (agent turn)
  "websocket"  -> _call_via_websocket(): same TTS/STT, one ws:// or wss:// connection
      PER TURN (opened, used once, closed — no persistent multi-turn session yet).
  "twilio"     -> app.core.twilio_bridge._call_via_twilio(): same TTS/STT, ONE PHONE
      CALL PER TURN (Phase 3A — no persistent multi-turn call yet either). See that
      module's docstring; it is a much larger subsystem than the other two, since
      Twilio's Media Streams protocol has no notion of "one turn" at all.

Failure handling deliberately mirrors app.core.adapter.send(): any failure (TTS, the
transport call itself, STT, or an unsupported/unknown protocol) resolves to the SAME
sentinel app.core.judge.AGENT_ERROR_SENTINEL ("<error>") that a transport failure
already produces for a chat agent, so the existing judge._endpoint_never_responded() /
_record_system_failure() machinery scores it exactly like an unreachable chat agent —
no new failure category for the Judge to learn.
