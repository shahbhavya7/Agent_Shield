"""Native persistent-WebSocket voice transport — voice_protocol == "native_ws".

Bridges a text scenario onto a target voice agent that speaks its own call-session
protocol: create a call over HTTP, then hold ONE WebSocket connection open for the
WHOLE scenario, driving each turn with a `simulated_utterance` JSON message and
reading back the agent's `"turn"` event as the reply. Modeled on
app.core.twilio_bridge's persistent-session pattern, but far simpler: this module is
a WebSocket *client*, not a server accepting an inbound stream, so there is no
webhook/router half to it at all.

Field reuse on the `agents` row (no schema changes — the same trick twilio_bridge
already plays with `endpoint_url` meaning something else for its own protocol):
    endpoint_url      -> HTTP base URL, e.g. "http://localhost:8000". Used for both
                         POST {base}/api/calls and, scheme-swapped (http -> ws,
                         https -> wss), the WebSocket URL — exactly what the target's
                         own frontend does (same-origin, protocol-swapped).
    request_template  -> the JSON body for POST /api/calls, e.g. {"client": "acme"}.
    auth_header       -> "Authorization: Bearer <token>", sent on the two HTTP calls
                         only — the WebSocket handshake itself carries no auth (the
                         call_id is the capability, per the target's own security
                         model: see its app/api/security.py).

Wire contract below is the TARGET's own (not ours) — see its
app/api/routes/simulator.py and app/transports/orchestrator_processor.py:
    POST {base}/api/calls          {request_template body} -> {"call_id": "<uuid>"}
    WS   {base}/api/ws/{call_id}   opened once, held for the whole scenario
        server -> client (JSON text frame), the only ones we act on:
            {"type": "turn", "role": "agent"|"caller", "text": "...", "end_status": ...}
        client -> server:
            {"type": "simulated_utterance", "text": "..."}
    POST {base}/api/calls/{call_id}/end   -> best-effort finalize

The instant the socket opens, the agent speaks first, unprompted — one "agent" turn
event arrives before we ever send anything. run_scenario()'s turn loop is
tester-first (seed turn -> reply), so that greeting has no transcript slot of its
own; it is captured as trace["opening_line"] on the FIRST turn rather than dropped
or misread as the reply to that turn's tester message.

Session store: one process-local dict, keyed by run_scenario()'s `session_key`
(its stable per-conversation id), same as twilio_bridge.py's `_SESSIONS_BY_KEY`. A
session is stored BEFORE the HTTP call that creates it is placed — same reason
twilio_bridge does this — so a later turn on the SAME session_key, if the first
turn's setup itself failed, sees "this session existed but died" and fails fast
rather than silently placing a second call. Final removal happens only in
close_native_ws_session(), guaranteed exactly once by run_scenario()'s `finally`.

Failure handling mirrors every other transport: any failure (HTTP create-call
error, WebSocket connect/send/recv error, an unexpected close, a malformed
message) resolves to the same AGENT_ERROR_SENTINEL ("<error>") the rest of the
system already knows how to score as a system failure — no Judge change needed.
